# Siniloan Enterprise Data Management

An internal municipal data-governance application for Siniloan. It provides controlled access to three operational datasets—jobseeker records, research and data requests, and biometric device events—using a Next.js web application and Supabase/PostgreSQL.

> This system is designed for sensitive government data. Use only approved data, accounts, infrastructure, and retention procedures. Do not commit credentials or real personal data to this repository.

## What the system does

- Lets municipal personnel request an account, then keeps it pending until Data Privacy Officer (DPO) review.
- Applies role- and dataset-level access controls for DPOs, Data Stewards, and Staff.
- Manages the Jobseeker Registry, Research & Data Requests, and Biometrics Data modules.
- Supports searchable, paginated record views, controlled manual entry, dashboards, and audit activity.
- Imports CSV and XLSX files into all datasets; legacy XLS is supported for biometrics only.
- Previews imports, rejects invalid/duplicate rows, records import jobs and row errors, and allows error CSV downloads.
- Enforces database-level protections with Supabase Auth, PostgreSQL Row Level Security (RLS), audited operations, and rate limiting.

## Technology

- Next.js 16, React 19, and TypeScript
- Supabase Auth, PostgreSQL, Storage, and Supabase CLI
- ExcelJS and `@e965/xlsx` for workbook imports
- Recharts and Phosphor Icons for the interface

## Data modules

| Module | Purpose | Main schema |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Jobseeker Registry | Employment profiles, qualifications, training, and work preferences | `jobseekers` |
| Research & Data Requests | Controlled intake and tracking of research/data requests | `research` |
| Biometrics Data | Attendance-device event metadata and personnel identifiers | `biometrics` |

Shared accounts, access grants, imports, audit events, and governance records are in the `core` schema. The complete implementation and data-governance rationale are documented in [docs/database-implementation.md](docs/database-implementation.md) and [docs/enterprise-data-management-plan.md](docs/enterprise-data-management-plan.md).

## Access model

| Role | Capabilities |
| --- | --- |
| DPO | Approves/rejects accounts, manages departments and access grants, and sees the administrative overview and system activity. |
| Data Steward | Sees the administrative overview and system-wide activity; access to source records still requires dataset grants. |
| Staff | Can use only the datasets and access modes explicitly granted by the DPO. |

Dataset grants are independent of roles and may be `read_only` or `read_write`. No grant means no access. Database policies are the authority; hiding a screen in the UI is not considered access control.

## Requirements

- Node.js 20.9 or later (current LTS recommended)
- npm
- Docker Desktop (for local Supabase)
- Supabase CLI, available through this project’s dev dependency (`npx supabase` / npm scripts)

## Local setup

1. Install dependencies and start the local Supabase stack:

   ```bash
   npm ci
   npm run db:start
   ```

2. Run `npm run db:status` and copy the local API URL, publishable/anon key, and service-role key into `.env.local`. Start from `.env.example`:

   ```bash
   Copy-Item .env.example .env.local
   ```

   The URL must be the Supabase project/API base URL (for example, `http://127.0.0.1:54321`), not a REST endpoint such as `/rest/v1/`.

   ```dotenv
   NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=http://127.0.0.1:54321
   NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=your-local-anon-or-publishable-key
   SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=your-local-service-role-key
   ```

3. Start the application:

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

   Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

Local database migrations are applied when the Supabase stack is initialized. To recreate the local database from migrations, use `npm run db:reset`; it removes local database data.

## Common commands

| Command | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `npm run dev` | Run the Next.js development server. |
| `npm run build` | Create a production build. |
| `npm run start` | Serve a production build. |
| `npm run lint` | Run ESLint. |
| `npm run db:start` | Start the local Supabase stack. |
| `npm run db:stop` | Stop the local Supabase stack. |
| `npm run db:status` | Show local Supabase URLs and keys. |
| `npm run db:reset` | Reset the local database and reapply migrations. |
| `npm run db:test` | Run pgTAP database tests. |
| `npm run db:types` | Regenerate Supabase TypeScript types from the local schemas. |

Before handing off a change, run:

```bash
npm run lint
npm run build
npm run db:test
```

`scripts/verify-record-pagination.mjs` is an additional authenticated integration check. It requires a running app, a user with sufficient test data/access, and `TEST_USERNAME` plus `TEST_PASSWORD` in the environment.

## Import rules

- Maximum upload: 25 MB and 25,000 data rows.
- Supported formats: CSV and XLSX for all modules; XLS only for Biometrics.
- Imports are previewed before commit and blocked when the exact file was already completed.
- Files are limited to 10 import attempts per actor/fingerprint per hour.
- Jobseeker rows require surname and first name; research rows require requester name and title/purpose; biometric rows require name, personnel number, and valid date/time.

Treat the supplied `sampla-data/` workbooks as sample inputs. Validate headers, data quality, department assignment, lawful purpose, and retention requirements before importing operational data.

## Production deployment

1. Create and secure a Supabase project, then link and push the versioned migrations:

   ```bash
   npx supabase login
   npx supabase link --project-ref YOUR_PROJECT_REF
   npx supabase db push
   ```

2. Configure Supabase Auth with the production site URL and approved redirect URLs.
3. Deploy the app (for example, to Vercel) with `npm ci` and `npm run build`.
4. Set these environment variables in the deployment platform:

   | Variable | Value |
   | --- | --- |
   | `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL` | Hosted Supabase project base URL, e.g. `https://YOUR_PROJECT_REF.supabase.co` |
   | `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY` | Hosted project publishable/anon key |
   | `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` | Hosted project service-role key; server-only |

5. Provision the first DPO through the controlled operational process before onboarding staff. Do not promote the first public registrant or expose service credentials to the browser.

Never run `db:reset` against a production project. Review `supabase/seed.sql` before using any seed material outside local development.

## Repository layout

```text
app/                    Next.js pages and API route handlers
components/             Application UI and record-management components
lib/                    Supabase clients, authorization, security, and database helpers

```

## Security notes

- Keep `.env`, `.env.local`, tokens, keys, and production exports out of version control.
- Treat `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` as a server secret; it bypasses ordinary RLS policies.
- Use the migration history as the source of truth for schema and authorization changes.
- Do not place raw biometric templates, passwords, or unapproved sensitive fields in the application or sample data.
- Confirm DPO approval, legal authority, field classification, retention, and incident-response procedures before production use.
